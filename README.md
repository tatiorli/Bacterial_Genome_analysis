# Regulatory Submission Report

## Bioinformatics Analysis of *Microbacterium arborescens* JCMM 5884 (DSM 20754)

This report summarizes the bioinformatics analysis performed for the EFSA submission on the whole genome sequencing (WGS) of microorganisms intentionally used in the food chain, specifically as a probiotic food supplement.

The analyzed bacterial strain is **Microbacterium arborescens** JCMM 5884 (DSM 20754), claimed by the manufacturer. The objective of this study was to:

- Verify and describe the full genome of the bacterium
- Identify the enzyme of interest (xylose isomerase)
- Characterize the full protein sequence of the enzyme

The bacterium is **not genetically modified** and was analyzed as obtained directly from the original manufacturer.

ðŸ”¬ The enzyme of interest, **xylose isomerase**, was successfully identified and characterized.
