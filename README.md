Regulatory Submission report  
Bioinformatics analysis of bacterial Microbacterium arborensens spp. - For EFSA submission of WGS analysis of microorganisms intentionally used in the food chain (as a food probiotiec complement).

The used bacterial strain is claimed to be Microbacterium arborensens JCMM 5884 (DSM20754). 
The objective of this bioinformatics analysis was to veriify and describe the full genome of this bacterium species, and to identify the claimed enzyme of interest, and characterize the protein full sequence.
This bacterium produces xylose isomerase, which is the enzyme of interest. The organism did not undergo genetic modifications and was used as obtained from the original manufacturer.
